This is the KMI bigwig script for the QuNeo controller

Import the QuNeo preset to your QuNeo using the editor. There aren’t any name displays, the preset will overwrite whichever slot you have selected on import. Be sure to use a slot that you aren’t fond of. Of course, you can restore defaults at any time, and then re-import on a different slot.
