This is the KMI bigwig script for the QuNeo controller

Import the QuNeo preset to your QuNeo using the editor. I recommend using slot 16 (the upper right corner. I have included a syses callback that restore all the LED feedback when returning to slot 16. If you use a different slot, and change presets, or accidentally hit the blue preset selection button in the upper left, the LED feedback will   not be visible until you interact with the device. 

Drop The 'QUNEO_Script'folder into the 'ControlSurfaceScripts' folder in the User Control script folder: 
 
Mac and Linux: ~/Documents/Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts/
On Windows:  %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Bitwig Studio\Controller Scripts\

Documentation on the layout is included in the KMI_BitwigScripts Folder.
